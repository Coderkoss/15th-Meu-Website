                <dt>Overview</dt>
                <dd>
                It is the policy of the 15th MEU (SOC) Realism Unit to not allow multiple ArmA 3 unit membership, otherwise known as "dual clanning".   
		While we are only a gaming unit, it has been the experience of the Command Staff both within our time as leaders of the 15th as well as experience prior to creating the 15th MEU (SOC) Realism Unit that participation in a gaming unit is a time consuming process for even the most laidback of members.
		We feel that it would be unfair to this unit or any other unit should a member have to split his time and dedication between those units.  
		We do not push the 15th but rather push that a member or prospective member should choose one unit to concentrate their time with whoever that should be.  
		In an effort to enforce and guide members this policy is made effective.

                <dt>Definitions</dt>
                <dd>
         Arma 3 Gaming Unit - A gaming organization that has an Arma 3 division qualification. A unit that plays total conversion mods, such as Breaking Point, does not fall under this category.</br>
           Dual Clanning - The act of participating as a member of the 15th MEU (SOC) Realism Unit and any other ArmA 3 gaming unit.
                </dd>
                <dt>New Applicants</dt>
                <dd>
No member that joins this unit can be a current and active member of another Arma 3 gaming unit regardless if they are part of that division or not.
		Recruiting staff, with the assistance of the S-1 Personnel Section, will make every effort to confirm that a new applicant to the 15th is not a member of another ArmA 3 Gaming clan or unit prior to approving their application. 
		Should a new recruit be found on the roster of another unit a confirmation private message or meeting in TeamSpeak to confirm the applicant's status should be made giving the applicant a chance to correct the situation or withdraw their application. 
		Any new applicant in the Receiving Platoon undergoing training found to be participating with another Arma 3 gaming unit will be given the same courtesy.

                <dt>Active and Reserve Members</dt>
                <dd>
                   No member, active or reserve, shall become a member of another Arma 3 gaming unit during their time with this unit. 
		Should a member be found to be maintained on another roster and confirmation can be made that they are active in that unit they shall be immediately subject to an Other Than Honorable Discharge from the 15th MEU (SOC) Realism Unit. 
		Return to the unit at a later date will be at the discretion of the Command Staff and said member.
                </dd>
                <dt>Active and Reserve Members</dt>
                <dd>
               Retired personnel are maintained on our Retired Personnel List in honor of their service to the unit. 
		Although they maintain their place on that roster, they are no longer actual members of the unit and are free to join other ArmA III units at their discretion.
                </dd>
                <dt>Exceptions for Different Era</dt>
                <dd>
                    Though members are not allowed to be a member of another ArmA III clan or realism unit, exceptions are allowed for units who operate solely in a different era.
		The 15th MEU (SOC) Realism Unit operates, officially, exclusively in the modern era. 
		Members are, therefore, allowed to be members of units or clans who, officially, operate in eras such as WWII, Vietnam, futuristic, etc.
                </dd>
				<dt>Conclusion</dt>
                <dd>
                  The Command Staff has no issue with members resigning to go participate in other gaming units should one feel the need. 
		The issue arises when a member does so while a part of this unit. 
		Therefore it is in a member’s best interest to simply resign from the 15th to pursue other options; should the other option not be fruitful said member could return to the ranks of the 15th with open arms.
