# 15th-Meu-Website
The 15th Meu Realism unit is a site built for an Arma 3 Gaming cummunity. The website was in use from 9/2015 -  2/2017.

-There is a video that plays in the background of the home page on the real site. This video is to big to upload to github as it will only allow me to send a file up to 25mb so the video will not play.

-On the Calander page there is a calander that should be there but it was not included for the same reason that the homepage video was not included (filesize).
