                First and foremost - we are NOT the real 15th Marine Expeditionary
                Unit. We are an ArmA III Realism Unit with a very high view of the
                Corps, and a very high view on realistic gaming. We gather and play
                to simulate a Marine Corps environment, in honor of the real Leathernecks
                who serve. The real 15th MEU can be found at the following site:<br />
                <br />
                <a class="RealMeuLink" href="http://www.15thmeu.marines.mil/" style="color:cornflowerblue; ">
                    <img src="images/final.png" alt="black" style="width: 50%;  margin:25%; margin-bottom:0px; margin-top:0px;" />
                </a>
                <br /> <br />ArmA III is a great combat simulator that is very conducive
                to the environment we've set here. ArmA III information can be found
                at
                <a class="RealMeuLink" href="http://www.arma3.com/" style=" color: #25935b;">
                    http://arma3.com/

                </a>
                <br />
                Specifically, we play ArmA III with a custom modpack that includes
                various community modifications like Task Force Arrowhead Radio and
                to provide the most unique realistic environment possible.<br />
                <br />We're simulating a Marine environment in a virtual world - same
                ranks, same ideals, same values. Hell, even a few of our members are
                Marines or are planning to serve in the Corps. They bring their
                experience to the table to further enhance our Unit.<br /><br />We strive
                to create an environment that is both professional and responsible, and at
                the same time relaxing and enjoyable. Realism gaming to us is the balance
                between the real world Marine Corps and the gaming world.<br />
                <br />We uphold the Corps Values of Honor, Courage and Commitment:<br />
                <br /> <strong>
                    Honor: Marines are held to a high standard of the utmost ethical
                    and moral behavior. Honesty and honor are held in great regard. Respect
                    for others is essential. You are expected to act responsibly in a mature
                    and dependable manner. Every Marine is accountable for his or her actions
                    and meeting the highest standard of the Corps.<br /> <br /> Courage: Courage
                    is not the absence of fear. It is the ability to face fear and overcome it.
                    It is the mental, moral and physical strength ingrained in Marines. It
                    steadies them in times of stress, carries them through every challenge and
                    aids them in facing new and unknown confrontations.<br /> <br /> Commitment:
                    Commitment is the spirit of determination and dedication found in Marines.
                    It is what impels Marines to serve our country and the Corps. Every aspect
                    of life in the Corps shows commitment, from the high standard of excellence
                    to the vigilances the Marines show for training.
                </strong><br /> <br /> Why
                do we do this? We'd like to think that a member in our unit would take from
                these and be a better person for it. A better person for the unit and hopefully
                a better person in life. They will learn what it is work together in team and work
                towards a common goal. They will learn what the words "determination" and "dedication"
                mean. They will learn to be dependable, respectful, and respectable.<br /> <br />
                They will earn the right to be called a Virtual Marine in the 15th MEU (SOC) Realism
                Unit, and they will uphold all that comes with that title so not to tarnish the
                great name of the Corps and those who serve it.<br /> <br />The 15th MEU (SOC)
                Realism Unit is one of the longest standing realism units within the ArmA Community,
                having been activated in June 2007. Since that time we have experienced many
                expansions and reductions, and various changes of command. Our foundation is
                solid, having stood some of the toughtest tests realism gaming, and group
                gaming as a whole, can muster. We are here to stay, and will continue to
                set the standard for realism gaming as our founders laid the basis for,
                even thought they have long departed our ranks.<br /><br />If this sounds
                like something you're interested in, by all means please register and let
                us know. But keep in mind, once you take that step and commit to joining,
                we're going to hold you the same standards we hold every other member to.<br />
